Traditional reports lack interactivity and predictive capabilities.
This project builds an AI-driven dashboard to analyze historical sales data and forecast future sales trends.


##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Power BI


##  Dataset
- Superstore Sales Dataset (5,000 records)
- Includes sales, profit, region, category, discount, and time-based features


##  Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Machine Learning (Sales Forecasting)
5. Power BI Dashboard Development

##  Machine Learning
- Models Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor
- Evaluation Metrics: MAE, R²
- Final Model: Linear Regression


##  Power BI Dashboard
